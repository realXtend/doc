The lab created the Military Open Simulator Enterprise Strategy
(MOSES) last year to test the stability and reliability of open source
virtual worlds. Previously, many of the agencies had been using the
commercial Second Life platform, but Maxwell said he and others
decided to migrate to a more customizable platform that offered
options for information assurance and security.  FCW

.. could we be running the same tests? for stability and reliability,
for security.

would be also interesting to know about their customizations -- given
our platform strives for customizability, and does a great job we
figure, but OTOH OpenSimulator Region and other Modules and .net are
kind of nice too (people do like the .net (mono) scripting in Unity3d
too)
