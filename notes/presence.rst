Maria Korolov discussing VWs for meetings:

"""
The advantage over GoToMeeting is first, the feeling of presence. You feel you are actually there with someone. When you do a GoToMeeting meeting, you don't actually feel like you've met the other person, or gone somewhere with them. When you have a meeting in a virtual environment, you feel that both of you were in the same physical location. This is great for establishing trust and rapport and developing relationships. 
"""

(before that was interestingly put for other reasons (ease of access,
browser based things?) 

Trying to get the customer into Second Life or OpenSim, if they've never been there before, would be a very big struggle -- like getting them into GoToMeeting or WebEx for the first time. You don't want to push that kind of thing too hard, not unless every other company is already on it and your customer is the last holdout.

However, if the customer is already in Second Life or OpenSim, then you can join them in their environment, or invite them to yours, bring in the slides, do the walk-throughs, whatever you need to do.

-- so these combines, is the realXtend Meeting Platform what we really
   should webify .. xmppify and, indeed, use. to be on the same boat
   (or are we?))
