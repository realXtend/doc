=======

Virtual World Interoperability of Avatar Information
http://andrewmkane.com/projects/capstone/capstone.pdf
* even though we propose to keep the concept of an avatar out of the 
  technical base,
  it is still a useful concept on a higher level,
  and we are also working on interoperability and standards on that front
  (new system using makehuman, rex av xml for 'universal avatar' to begin with)
