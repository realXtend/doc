Subject: 	[realXtend-dev] RealXtend Tundra 2.3.0 is released!
Date: 	February 28, 2012 9:51:34 PM GMT+02:00

- Implemented a new path for streaming rigid bodies over the network. This allows a far larger number of concurrent clients on a server. (#314, #322, #354)
  - Comparative profile of the Physics demo scene: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/40949268/Tundra/Tundra_RigidBody_PhysicsScene.png
  - Old rigid body streaming code was about 70bytes/update: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/40949268/Tundra/OldRigidBodyStreaming_70b.png
  - New code averages at about 11bytes/update: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/40949268/Tundra/NewRigidBodyPackets_11b.png
  - User counts as large as 64 users are doable, but largely depends on what is running in the scene: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/40949268/Tundra/kNetServer64users.png
