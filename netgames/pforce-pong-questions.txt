Pforce_: reading your pong game.js here and thinking about the article

the use of the json messages withing the entity action system is a bit curious

i wonder how it would compare with using the ec system more directly, either by putting state to attrs, or using separate entity actions for the different .. actions

latter would be, instead of:
 onServerData: function(jsonData) (...) 
    if (sd.key ==  "clientjoin") (...)  
    if (sd.key == "gamestate")
there would be onClientJoin and onGameStateChange as actions directly

if this JSON way is somehow more handy in your experience, it basically means that the entity-action system currently is somehow flawed as it is attractive to workaround it

so am curious to know how & why you ended up with that tech, if you'd have time to tell at some point

same for the use of sending json dicts instead of ec attrs

IDEA: port the game to use the ECA system more and compare?
