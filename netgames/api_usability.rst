API usability peer reviews: a method for evaluating the usability of application programming interfaces
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753677

We describe a usability inspection method to evaluate Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs). We found the method useful as it
identified usability defects in Microsoft's .NET Framework, of which
59% were new and 21% were fixed. Based on a comparison of usability
defects identified between API usability peer reviews and API
usability tests, API usability tests were found to expose design
issues related to actually using an API whereas API usability peer
reviews were found to expose the design rationale of an API. We
reflect on the efficiency and productivity of each method: each API
usability test is equivalent to 16 API usability peer reviews with the
former having a 2.5x productivity advantage. We discuss how API
usability peer reviews can be used in conjunction with API usability
tests to increase usability coverage on APIs.

An overview of API evaluation techniques Michael Barth

ABSTRACT
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are the “glue”
between software components. Almost all developers work
with APIs on a regular basis in one form or another, mak-
ing APIs one of the cornerstones of modern software devel-
opment. Still, evaluating and ensuring API qualities is an
often overlooked topic. In the past years, a lot of research
has been going on with the goal to come up with better evalu-
ation techniques and metrics to assess the qualities of APIs.
This paper analyses the current state of research. It starts
with an introduction to the problem and gives an overview of
five recent proposals for API evaluation techniques. Every
technique is introduced, described both in terms of necessary
preparations and the actual execution and concluded by a
summary that highlights benefits and drawbacks of the tech-
nique. Closing, a conclusion provides an overview of the
state of API evaluation techniques based on the five tech-
niques reviewed in this paper.
